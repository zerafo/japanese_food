                <p class="info">The first human inhabitants of the Japanese archipelago have been traced to the Paleolithic, around 38–39,000 years ago.
                    The Jōmon period, named after its cord-marked pottery, was followed by the Yayoi period in the first millennium BC when new inventions were introduced from Asia.
                    It is believed that modern Japanese people are composed of Jōmon, Northeast Asian (Yayoi) and the newly discovered East Asian ancestries. 
                    The Nikkei published an article that showed the Kofun strand in modern-day Japanese was concentrated in specific regions such as Kinki, Hokuriku and Shikoku.
                    Deeply rooted in Japan's unique Shinto religion and traditional agrarian lifestyle, Japan is a country with a vibrant “matsuri” culture.
                    Matsuri is the Japanese word for festival. You can read an article about traditional japanese food down below (a button).</p>
