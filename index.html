                <p class="second">Japanese - washoku</p>
                <p class="therd">It's one of the most popular and influential cuisines in the world, with a long and storied history that dates back centuries.
                     Is is based on rice with miso soup and other dishes; there is an emphasis on seasonal ingredients.
                     Encompasses the regional and traditional foods of Japan, which have developed through centuries of political, economic, and social changes.</p>
                <p class="ferth">Side dishes often consist of fish, pickled vegetables, and vegetables cooked in broth.</p>
                <p class="fefth">Apart from the purely restaurant experiences of kaiseki-ryori, Japanese cuisine tends to be simple, approachable and unsophisticated in a certain way.
                     It is best represented by the cooking in the small shops or at home, where dishes tend to be relatively easy to prepare.</p>

            <p class="third3">もち, 餅</p>
            <p class="forth3">made by pounding steamed short-grain Japanese sticky rice, called mochigome, with a wooden mallet during a ceremony called mochitsuki.
                This aerates and pulverizes the rice, which is what gives mochi its beloved texture.
                Traditional stuffed with anko (sweetened red bean paste) made from azuki beans.
                We usually enjoy this popular Japanese sweet with green tea.It is smoother than ice cream, so it melts in your mouth.
                It's made from a red bean paste, but is also sweet, so it still tastes like a dessert.</p>

                              That sweetness often comes from the addition of an apple and/or some honey.</p>
